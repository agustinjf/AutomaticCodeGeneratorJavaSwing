This is an Automatic Code/Application Generator in Java Swing.

The generated application will use 'automaticServer' as host to know where is the server.
The comunication between Client and Server is with 'RMI'

This project is an evolution of the 'FPG (Final Project Grade)'

* Possible problems:
Can not find javac when the application is compiling the automatic code
 - Copy the 'tools.jar' lib from jdk to jre 
  -- in mac .../lib/ext

What I'm going to do/improve
 - Improve the code templates
  -- Remove writed code from java aplication to only use templates
 - Manage modules that already exists (backups or generated modules)
 - Add others gui's
  -- List, Create, Edit, Consult
  -- Consult, Edit
 - Generate a dummy application in which load the generated modules (applications)
 - Configure to select which modules load in the application and which of them will be visibles.
  -- TODO explain in the future...
 - Manage differents types of data connection in the server (Redis, XML, Oracle, MySQL, etc).
